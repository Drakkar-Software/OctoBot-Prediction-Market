OctoBot Prediction Market is a free Polymarket trading robot that makes it simple and secure to automate prediction market trading strategies. It is built on top of [OctoBot](https://github.com/Drakkar-Software/OctoBot), an open source crypto trading bot.

OctoBot Prediction Market features:
- [Copy trading](#open-source-polymarket-copy-trading-bot) of Polymarket profiles to copy the best investors
- [Arbitrage strategies](#crypto-prediction-market-arbitrage-bot) to extract profits from market inefficiencies at low risk 
- [A great user interface](#a-great-user-interface-to-follow-your-strategies), telegram interface and upcoming mobile app
- [Risk-free paper trading](#risk-free-paper-trading-for-your-prediction-market-strategies) to test and optimize your strategies before using your real funds
- [Self Custody](#self-custody-polymarket-trading-bot) - no need to trust anyone: your keys always stay on your device
- [Upcoming Kalshi trading bot](#kalshi-trading-bot) to be among the first to automate strategies on Kalshi 

## Open source Polymarket copy trading bot
You identified a profile you would like to copy on the [polymarket leaderboard](https://polymarketanalytics.com/traders)? Or you know someone who you trust for a specific prediction?

## Crypto Prediction Market arbitrage bot
Polymarket is known for its arbitrage opportunities due to new market inefficiencies. As shown in [this Polymarket arbitrage bot study](https://medium.com/@michalstefanow.marek/inside-the-mind-of-a-polymarket-bot-3184e9481f0a), lots of profits can be extracted with the proper strategy.  
The core principle of these prediction market arbitrage strategies is to identify markets where an opportunity to **buy both sides of the bet costs less than 1**. As a result, regardless of the prediction's outcome, profits are generated.

While this is possible to do manually, most profits are generated by bots that have the ability to monitor markets 24/7 and quickly leverage arbitrage opportunities when they are still open. 

If you are interested in OctoBot Prediction Market's arbitrage robot, please add a 👍 or a comment to the [Polymarket Arbitrage Bot issue](https://github.com/Drakkar-Software/OctoBot-Prediction-Market/issues/2) to let us know you want it soon!

🚧 OctoBot Prediction Market's arbitrage bot is under development.

## A visual, easy to use and safe Prediction Market bot

### A great user interface to follow your strategies
OctoBot Prediction Market is built for crypto investors who want to automate prediction market strategies in a smart and optimized manner.

This bot uses a dedicated distribution of OctoBot, where the whole UI is optimized to make it as easy and clear as possible to:
- Connect to your prediction market account, like Polymarket
- Use the strategy of your choice
- Configure and test your strategy using [risk free paper money](#risk-free-paper-trading-for-your-prediction-market-strategies) before using your real holdings
- Follow your bot and track its profits from your computer
- Discuss with your bot [from Telegram](https://www.octobot.cloud/en/guides/octobot-interfaces/telegram?utm_source=github&utm_medium=dk&utm_campaign=regular_prediction_market_open_source_content&utm_content=from_telegram)

Unlike most Polymarket bots that simply run on Telegram, we decided to add a proper visual user interface to OctoBot Prediction Market. With this approach, we want to give users more control and monitoring tools for their strategy.

### Risk free paper trading for your prediction market strategies
When using an automated trading strategy, it's always crucial to test it first in a risk-free context using paper trading.  
Paper trading enables you to:
- Play with different strategies and configurations to understand how they work
- Test and compare strategies to select the one(s) you want to use
- Execute your target strategy for a few days to be sure it works exactly as you think

💡 Pro tip: "You sleep better when you know your strategy well enough to trust it will work as expected."  
Paper trading is here for this exact reason.

### Self custody Polymarket trading bot

> Not your keys, not your coins

OctoBot Prediction Market is a [self-custody trading bot](https://www.octobot.cloud/en/blog/how-to-use-a-self-custody-crypto-trading-bot?utm_source=github&utm_medium=dk&utm_campaign=regular_prediction_market_open_source_content&utm_content=self_custody_trading_bot), which means:
- Your Polymarket **keys never leave your computer** when using OctoBot Prediction Market
- OctoBot Prediction Market's strategies are 100% executed from your device, no external server is required

It is therefore technically impossible for any hacker (or even the OctoBot team) to access your Polymarket keys at any point when using OctoBot Prediction Market.

With a self custody bot, your funds are safe from external platform leaks.

💡 This is a **major difference compared to most Polymarket bots** that are running on Telegram and using a central server that has to store and read your keys at all times to execute any strategy.  
Unlike other Polymarket bots running on Telegram, this trading bot always runs on your system and can also be [connected to Telegram](https://www.octobot.cloud/en/guides/octobot-interfaces/telegram?utm_source=github&utm_medium=dk&utm_campaign=regular_prediction_market_open_source_content&utm_content=connected_to_telegram). This allows you to follow it from your mobile while always keeping your keys safe.

## Kalshi trading bot

OctoBot Prediction Market is built to support many prediction market platforms. While [Polymarket](https://polymarket.com/) is the first to be supported, we are planning on adding support for [Kalshi](https://kalshi.com/) in the near future as well.

Are you interested in a Kalshi trading bot? Please let us know by adding a 👍 or a comment to the [Support Kalshi prediction markets issue](https://github.com/Drakkar-Software/OctoBot-Prediction-Market/issues/4).
